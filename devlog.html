							<p>Welcome to our Devblog and hopefully you are interested in our project. With this being our first post i will be talking about what we have done if the first three weeks of our project.In the first week we all had met up for the first time. We had discussed what kind of atmosphere we wanted within our group in which was a relaxed and positive atmosphere in which the members were comfortable in talking to each other. Within this first week was also allocated everyone a task that we all shall fulfill each week whenever we had met up to do meeting and discussions. Mine personally was to be the team relectionist by discussing and addressing where the team might be lacking as well as adjusting accordingly.</p>
							
							<p>In Week 2 it was mainly about the pitch that we had to do for our module but before we could have done the pitch only 3 members of the group had played the game Risk. So to get everyone on the same boat we had played the game risk. By the end of the week everyone was able to play the game and had a good understanding of how the game works and had some idea of how we were going to create and implement the game onto a computer.</p>
							
							<p>In Week 3 now that we had a better understanding of how the game actually works we started to think about what we were going to implement. We didn't want to make an exact copy of risk so we decided instead of the normal risk where you are on earth we decided to make our game based in space. This allowed for more expansion in which we believe were going to make our game unique and interesting by adding easter eggs and other game mechanics in which the original version of risk didn't have. We also had decided that we were going to use Unity to make our game as Unity has some preexisting game physics which would save us a lot of time.
							</p>
							
							<p>Finally in Week 3 we had decided in what roles each member officially had. We all based everyones role from their strengths and weakness by analyzing and discussing with each other in which roles we were willing to accept and carryout while we were working on our project. Mine personally to be one of the four programmers along with Pedro, Sulaiman and Taz. </p>
